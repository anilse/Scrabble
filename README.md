Term project for CS534 - Simple Scrabble Board Game Implementation in JAVA

Our game is played by two players.

If a player could play a valid word, he/she gets marks for the letters of that word.

Our database is "words.txt".

Letter distribution and letter marks are referenced by Alfred Butts, the inventor of the Scrabble.

Our final UML is under Reports/ProgressReport_FinalUML. It is prepared on Gaphor.
